# Web Font Loader

We have created a Phaser 3 plugin to allow the loading of web fonts.  

There is a file called `fonts.json` in the root of the theme folder which can be used to load multiple fonts. Details on how to configure the loader can be found in the [Web Font Loader documentation](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/blob/master/README.md).
