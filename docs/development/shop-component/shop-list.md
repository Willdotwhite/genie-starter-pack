## Shop list

This is the screen which represents a shop inventory or the player's inventory, both of which are collections.

 It renders two buttons, "Shop" and "Manage" which route to different Shop List screens, the first intended for listing items available to purchase and the second for listing the player's inventory. Both of these collections are set in the Shop Menu config, e.g [themes/default/shop-menu/config.json5], along with other parameters.
